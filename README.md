# Lang Wars Benchmark
**It's just a game, you don't have to be mad :)**

## Round 1 (The Heart Strings)
Merge the two specified strings alternately, appending the current iteration counter.
`s1 = "ABCDEFH", s2 = "123456789"`
Result of first loop (0): `"A1B2C3D4E5F6H70890"`
Result of last loop (9999999): `""`
* Loops: 10'000'000
* Print out **only the first and last** loop result (so we know your logic is correct)
* Allocate `result` in a variable for all loops (can be released after that loop)
* Must work either `s1` or `s2` has more characters.
